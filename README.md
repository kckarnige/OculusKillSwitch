> _This program was made with the assumption that you followed the [Oculus Killer install guide](https://github.com/LibreQuest/OculusKiller#installation), and backed up your Oculus Dash executable as `OculusDash.exe.bak` as per the instructions._

> _Keep in mind, this is my first time coding in C#, that being said, if there are any bugs, [submit an issue](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusKillSwitch/issues), and feel free to make [pull requests](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusKillSwitch/pulls)._
