## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusKillSwitch/releases) Oculus Kill Switch

2. Move it to where your Oculus Dash is located, should be at `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-dash\dash\bin` by default.

3. Run it, it should ask to make a desktop shortcut for you and ask to download Oculus Killer (if you don't already have it installed).

4. That's it, run it again and enjoy!
