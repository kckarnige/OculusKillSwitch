## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusKillSwitch/releases/latest/download/OculusKillSwitch.exe) Oculus Kill Switch, and move it to where your Oculus Dash is located. If you can't find it, just open OKS and it should direct you to where the folder is.

2. Run it, it should ask to make a shortcut for you, it should also ask to download [Oculus Killer](https://github.com/kaitlyndotmoe/OculusKiller), if the file doesn't already exist in the directory.

3. That's it, if it closes, run it again and enjoy!
